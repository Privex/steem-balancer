#
# To use this file, copy it into /etc/systemd/system/steem-balancer.service , replace `stmbal` with the username of the Linux
# account it was installed into, and adjust the paths if necessary.
#
# Once adjusted for your specific installation, run the following:
#
#    systemctl enable steem-balancer.service
#    systemctl start steem-balancer.service
#
# steem-balancer will now have started in the background as a systemd service, and will automatically start on reboot
